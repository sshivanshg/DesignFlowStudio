3. CRM → Lead → Create Estimate → Shared Estimate + Edit flow
4. CRM → Lead → Start Project → Show in /projects → Sync status to /client-portal
5. Proposal → Approved → Update status + notify via WhatsApp
6. Billing Plan → Update plan in Supabase → Feature gate access
7. Moodboard → Shared → View-only in client portal with feedback
8. Logs from projects → Auto-export to weekly PDF or email
